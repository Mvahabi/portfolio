									<p>
										<strong>Computer Science Expert AI Training<br>Remote Work (United States)</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Operated on various projects to train generative AI models: ranking a series of code responses produced by an AI model, writing pieces of code with reasoning to show an AI model how to respond to prompts, and editing code written by an AI model to fix bugs and improve performance. Through these dynamic projects, I not only honed my expertise in AI model training but also cultivated a deep understanding of the intricacies involved in guiding AI systems toward more accurate and impactful outputs.

										<strong>Course Tutor and Grader</strong><br>
										<strong>Baskin School of Engineering @ UCSC</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										I provide personalized one-on-one instruction to students in data structures, machine learning, linear algebra, and calculus. Using my in-depth understanding of these topics, I help students master key concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and gain confidence in their abilities. I work with students of all levels, from beginners to advanced learners, and use a variety of teaching methods to accommodate diverse learning styles. Through my tutoring services, students have achieved notable academic success and increased their proficiency in these subjects.

									<p>
										<strong>SWE Intern</strong><br>
										<strong>Baskin School of Engineering @ UCSC</strong> 
									</p>
									<p>
										During my tenure as a Software Engineering Intern, I spearheaded the development of a transformative API in Python, centered around leveraging the power of Machine Learning techniques. My primary responsibility involved analyzing and recognizing intricate patterns within vast sets of patients' medical data to predict both minor and major diagnoses accurately. By seamlessly integrating advanced predictive models into the API, I contributed to the early detection and potential prevention of life-threatening conditions. My role further encompassed comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing, ensuring the API's reliability and efficiency in handling crucial healthcare information. Through my dedication and innovative approach, I played a pivotal part in creating a lifesaving solution that has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare landscape.

										<strong>SWE Intern</strong><br>
										<strong>Learning and Experimental Economics Projects Lab @ UCSC</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										I served as a pioneering force in advancing economics research by conducting simulations of novel economic theories. Leveraging oTree, I engineered a sophisticated web interface and utilized Python to execute intricate scripts, optimizing the user experience and data processing performance. By employing this innovative approach, I significantly improved the responsiveness of graphing mechanisms for presenting data to users, offering a more intuitive and visually engaging platform. My dedication to this project contributed to a cutting-edge solution, which not only enhanced the efficiency of data calculations but also provided valuable insights into the dynamics of economic theories, shaping the future of research in the field.

										<strong> Mentee</strong><br>
										<strong> Pasatiempo Golf Course</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Project at a local golf club, applying hardware and networking skills to relocate the networking systems to an efficient environment. Made new Ethernet CAT5/6 cables appropriate to the new adjustments for the devices used all over the golf course.
										This initiative not only improved network performance but also demonstrated my ability to seamlessly integrate technology into real-world scenarios, enhancing operational efficiency across the golf course's infrastructure.
